## ü§ñ What is FlowGen

FlowGen is a tool built for [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/), a great agent framework from Microsoft and [a lot of contributors](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen?tab=readme-ov-file#contributors-wall).

We regard AutoGen as one of the best frontier technology for next-generation Multi-Agent Applications. FlowGen elevates this concept, providing intuitive visual tools that streamline the construction and oversight of complex agent-based workflows, thereby simplifying the entire process for creators and developers.

### Autoflow Visual Editing

You can create a autoflow from scratch, or fork from a template. The autoflow is visualized as a graph, and you can drag and drop nodes to build agents in flow style.

![flow-1](./website/static/img/screenshot-flow-1.png)

### Chat

You can launch an autoflow or a template in a chat window, and chat with the agents.

### Gallery

Place to share and discover flow templates.

## üí° Quickstart

To quickly explore what FlowGen has to offer, simply visit it [https://flowgen.app](https://flowgen.app).

For a more in-depth look at the platform, please refer to our [Getting Started](https://docs.flowgen.app/getting-started) and [other documents](https://docs.flowgen.app).

## Migration of Official Notebooks

We made tutorials based on the official notebooks from Autogen repository. You can refer to the original notebook [here](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/notebook/).

## üê≥ Run on Local (with Docker)

The project contains Frontend (Built with Next.js) and Backend service (Built with Flask in Python), and have been fully dockerized.

The easiest way to run on local is using docker-compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

You can also build and run the ui and service separately with docker:

```bash
docker build -t flowgen-api ./api
docker run -d -p 5004:5004 flowgen-api

docker build -t flowgen-ui ./ui
docker run -d -p 2855:2855 flowgen-ui

docker build -t flowgen-db ./pocketbase
docker run -d -p 7676:7676 flowgen-db
```

(The default port number 2855 is the address of our first office.)

## üöÄ Deployment

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/template/NCoZBC?referralCode=5I-BUc)

Railway.app supports the deployment of applications in Dockers. By clicking the "Deploy on Railway" button, you'll streamline the setup and deployment of your application on Railway platform:

1. Click the "Deploy on Railway" button to start the process on Railway.app.
2. Log in to Railway and set the following environment variables:
   - `PORT`: Please set for each services as `2855`, `5004`, `7676` respectively.
3. Confirm the settings and deploy.
4. After deployment, visit the provided URL to access your deployed application.

## üõ†Ô∏è Run on Local (Without Docker)

If you're interested in contributing to the development of this project or wish to run it from the source code, you have the option to run the ui and service independently. Here's how you can do that:

1. **Frontend Service:**

   - Navigate to the ui directory.
   - Rename `.env.sample` to `.env.local` and set the value of variables correctly.
   - Install the necessary dependencies using the appropriate package manager command (e.g., `pnpm install` or `yarn`).
   - Run the ui service using the start-up script provided (e.g., `pnpm dev` or `yarn dev`).

2. **Backend Service:**

   - Switch to the api service directory `cd api`.
   - Create virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`.
   - Activate virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`.
   - Install all required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
   - Launch the api service using command `uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 5004`.

`REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` is needed for LLaVa agent. If you need to use this agent, make sure to include this token in environment variables, such as the Environment Variables on Railway.app.

3. **PocketBase:**

   - Switch to the PocketBase directory `cd pocketbase`.
   - Build the container: `docker build -t flowgen-db .`
   - Run the container: `docker run -it --rm -p 7676:7676 flowgen-db`

Each new commit to the main branch triggers an automatic deployment on [Railway.app](https://railway.app), ensuring you experience the latest version of the service.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Changes to Pocketbase project will cause the rebuild and redeployment of all instances, which will swipe all the data.
>
> Please do not use it for production purpose, and make sure you export flows in time.

Once you've started both the ui and api services by following the steps previously outlined, you can access the application by opening your web browser and navigating to:

- Frontend: http://localhost:2855
- Backend: http://localhost:5004 (OpenAPI docs served at http://localhost:5004/redoc)
- PocketBase: http://localhost:7676

If your services are started successfully and running on the expected ports, you should see the user interface or receive responses from the api services via this URL.
