# Getting Started

## What is FlowGen

FlowGen is a tool built for [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/), a fantastic agent framework from Microsoft Research.

AutoGen streamlines the process of creating multi-agent applications with its clear and user-friendly approach. FlowGen takes this accessibility a step further by offering visual tools that simplify the building and management of agent workflows.

## Basic Concepts

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Agent

The `Agent` is the core concept in AutoGen and FlowGen. For applications, this usually means a `ConversableAgent`, which includes two types: `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent`.

- üë©‚Äçüíº **Assistant Agent**

  The `AssistantAgent` is your go-to helper to accomplish a task‚Äîit could be a chatbot, a code generator, or a planner‚Äîperhaps even a blend of them.

- üßë‚Äçüíª **UserProxy Agent**

  The `UserProxyAgent` enables interaction with the `AssistantAgent`. It can take the form of a chatbot, a code executor, or even a human‚Äîit's quite the versatile agent.

### üåä Autoflow

A `Autoflow` consists of a network of `Agents`. It's the foundation of any multi-agent application.

A standard Autoflow usually includes one `UserProxyAgent` and one or several `AssistantAgents`. The `UserProxyAgent` is your direct line of interaction, while the `AssistantAgents` work behind the scenes, collaborating to build a robust multi-agent application.

### üìÑ AutoflowTemplate

Ready to launch a Autoflow? Publish it as a `AutoflowTemplate` in the [FlowGen Gallery](https://flowgen.app/gallery/)! Users can then deploy these templates to conjure up new Autoflows or strike up chats directly on the template itself.

### üí¨ Chat

Each Chat represents a live session that has been spun up from a Autoflow or a AutoflowTemplate.

## "Hello World"

Let's jump straight in and create a simple "Hello World" flow.

### Initialize a New Autoflow

Head over to [FlowGen Login](https://flowgen.app/auth/login) and tap **Login as Guest** for a test run without the need to sign up.

> Guest mode means your data is an open book to other guests. Sign in with your GitHub/Google/X account for a private experience.

Once you're in, go to the [homepage](https://flowgen.app) and hit the 'Build from Scratch' button to weave a new Autoflow.

### Build Your First Autoflow

Get started by tidying up the canvas‚Äîscrap any sample nodes that are hanging about. Now, let's get crafting:

1. Tap the plus sign ‚®Å in the top left and ferry over an **Assistant Agent**.
2. Next, snag a **UserProxy Agent** and drop it in place.
3. Connect these two, and voil√†‚Äîyou've got flow! üîó

Here‚Äôs a visual to guide you through:

### Start Chat

Fire up your flow by smashing the **Start Chat** button at the top right. Pop in the message `tell a story` and watch the magic unfold in your chat window:

## Next Steps

This tutorial was a breezy run-through, almost like a simplified ChatGPT.

Notice the conversation's quick? Just one round and boom, done‚Äî`UserProxyAgent` gets the message, and that's a wrap. But hey, let's spice things up with more features to give that flow a bit more oomph. Keep your eyes peeled! üëÄ
