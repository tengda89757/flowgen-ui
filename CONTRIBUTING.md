# Contributing to FlowGen

Firstly, thank you for considering contributing to FlowGen! It's people like you that make the open-source community such a fantastic place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

## Code of Conduct

FlowGen follows a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read [the full text](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please ensure the issue hasn't already been reported by searching through the existing issues.

**If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, feel free to open a new one.** When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible by filling out the provided template. The more information we have, the better we can understand and fix the issue.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have suggestions for how to improve FlowGen, we'd love to hear them! Just like with bug reports, please take a moment to check that an enhancement hasn't already been suggested or implemented. If it hasn't, you can go ahead and propose your idea by opening a new issue and using the enhancement template.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to FlowGen? You can start by looking through 'beginner' and 'help-wanted' issues:

* [Beginner issues](https://github.com/tiwater/flowgen/issues?q=label%3Aeasy) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/tiwater/flowgen/issues?q=label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved than 'beginner' issues.

Both lists are sorted by how recently they were created. If you decide to tackle an issue, leave a comment so that other contributors know it's being handled and can offer help if needed.

### Pull Requests

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

### Get in Touch

You can join our Slack or Discord(COMMUNICATION_PLATFORM_LINK) to discuss the project with the maintainers and other contributors.

## Contributing Guidelines

- Write clean code with appropriate comments and abide by the coding conventions set by the community.
- Test your code, and write new tests as needed to maintain a robust codebase.
- Include documentation with your changes. No change is too small to warrant a mention in the project's documentation.
- Pull requests need to reference the original issue being addressed. Please add a reference to the issue in the pull request description.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before you start on your contribution, you'll need to set up your environment for development. See the `README.md` for instructions on getting started.

Staying up-to-date with what's happening in the FlowGen community is important. Come back periodically for the latest updates, discussions, and contribution opportunities.

## Recognition
